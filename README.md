## Description
This is a fork of L2J server emulator.  
It's an open-source project that works with `Chronicle 4: Scions of Destiny` client.

## Project status
I have been working on this project for years with the aid of its users and without profit.  
Real life responsibilities and the importance of time altogether have made me slow down development.  
On top of that, years have passed and game is old. Even so, I still apply improvements whenever I get some free time.
